If you have problems training on KITTI, please make sure to check:

1. That you are using an unmodified version of the codebase
2. That you are using the correct versions of the dependencies we specified in the README

If youâ€™ve checked both of these, please feel report here the problem you are having, together with your hardware and anything else potentially unusual about your setup.
